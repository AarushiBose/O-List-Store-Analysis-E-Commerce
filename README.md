# O-List Store Analysis (E-Commerce Data Analysis)

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing data from an E-commerce store, transforming it into actionable insights through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The data is processed in Excel, analyzed with MySQL queries, and visualized in interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau. The objective is to drive data-informed decision-making by uncovering patterns in customer behavior, identifying high-performing products, and optimizing sales strategies.

The Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist contains data on 100,000 orders made between 2016 and 2018 across multiple Brazilian marketplaces, offering a detailed view of each transaction, including order status, price, payment, freight, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews. This anonymized dataset also includes geolocation data linking Brazilian zip codes to geographic coordinates, allowing for geographic and logistic analysis. Provided by Olist, Brazil’s largest marketplace integrator, the dataset offers valuable insights into customer behavior, regional sales trends, and delivery performance.

## Tools
1. Excel : For initial data cleaning and transformation.
2. MySQL : To run the SQL queries provided.
3. Power BI & Tableau (BI Tools) : To view or edit the interactive dashboards.

## Objective
1. Enhance data-driven decision-making by transforming raw sales data into meaningful insights.

2. Optimize E-commerce performance by identifying trends, high-performing products, and analyzing customer preferences.

3. Deliver actionable insights through visual storytelling, helping stakeholders understand complex data quickly.

## Project Components
**1. Data Cleaning and Transformation (Excel)**

9 CSV files were processed in Excel, where data cleaning and transformation were applied to prepare the data for analysis. This included:

-> Removing duplicates and handling missing values.

-> Standardizing data formats across files.

-> Merging datasets to create a unified view for analysis.

**2. SQL Data Analysis (MySQL)**

Complex SQL queries were written to extract and analyze insights from the cleaned dataset. Key analysis points included:

-> Weekend vs. Weekday Sales: Evaluated payment trends, showing that 77.21% of sales occurred on weekdays.

-> Payment and Satisfaction: Identified high satisfaction levels among customers using credit card payments.

-> Delivery Analysis: Calculated average delivery days, particularly for pet shop products, highlighting areas for improvement in logistics.

-> Regional Insights: Assessed customer distribution across states, finding that São Paulo (SP) had the highest number of customers.

-> Product Performance: Determined top-performing product categories, with "beleza_saude" leading in sales.

**3. Dashboarding and Visualization**

Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI and Tableau, presenting key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights derived from the data:

-> Power BI Dashboard: Visualized sales trends, customer distribution, top products, and delivery performance with Smart Narrative Cards for storytelling.

-> Tableau Dashboard: Illustrated payment methods, customer satisfaction by region, and product category performance.


**4. Findings and Recommendations (Documented in PDF Report)**

The findings were documented with strategic recommendations:

-> Increase Weekday Marketing Efforts: Since weekday sales are higher, focusing marketing on weekdays could maximize revenue.

-> Improve Delivery for Pet Products: Faster logistics for pet products may enhance customer satisfaction.

-> Promote High Satisfaction Payment Methods: Encouraging credit card payments could boost satisfaction.

-> Focus on São Paulo Customers: São Paulo has the highest customer base, making it a key target for campaigns.

## Insights and Recommendations
The analysis yielded several actionable insights, such as the benefit of enhancing weekday marketing efforts, optimizing delivery for specific product categories, and focusing on regional customer trends. These findings are intended to guide strategies for boosting sales, improving customer satisfaction, and enhancing overall business performance.
